I am learning that it is best to do things and see what happens. 
 This is how I am learning this as I learn rust through the rust book.

I think the best way to learn rust with a solid foundation and achieve a decent skill level, is to start making small scale projects and the earliest moment possible. 
I looked into it online and believe that chapter 6 can allow tiny projects for the basics, whereas chapter 12 is where I'll stop for a while to focus on other areas for programming and build multiple decent CLI projects in that period before moving on to greater things
